\#\# General Information  
\- Multiple linear regression is performed on the dataset.  
\- We are trying to find the number of rentals issued from the company based on numerous independent values such as temperature, weather, humidity, holiday, etc.  
\-Boombikes bike rental dataset is being used  
   
\<\!-- You don't have to answer all the questions \- just the ones relevant to your project. \--\>  
   
\#\# Conclusions  
\- The R-squared value of the train set is 82.19% whereas the test set has a value of 80.88% which suggests that our model broadly explains the variance quite accurately on the test set and thus we can conclude that it is a good model.  
\- Our developed model's mean squared error is almost 0 on both the training and testing datasets which suggests that the variance is accurately predicted on the test set. The p-values and VIF were used to select the significant variables. RFE was also conducted for automated selection of variables.  
\- The major steps included in the python notebook are data interpretation, data visualization, data pre-processing, model training, feature selection, residual analysis, model evaluation on the test set.  
\- Concepts such as EDA, p-value, VIF, RFE were used and model building was done using statsmodels library
